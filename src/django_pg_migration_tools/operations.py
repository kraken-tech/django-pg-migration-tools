    This class mimics the behaviour of:
        django.contrib.postgres.operations.AddIndexConcurrently

    However, it uses `django.db.migrations.operations.base.Operation` as a base
    class due to limitations of Django's AddIndexConcurrently operation.

    One such limitation is that Django's AddIndexConcurrently operation does
    not provide easy hooks so that we can add the conditional `IF NOT EXISTS`
    to the `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` command, which is something we must have
    here.

    As a compromise, this class implements the same input interface as Django's
    AddIndexConcurrently, so that the developer using it doesn't "feel" any
    differences.
